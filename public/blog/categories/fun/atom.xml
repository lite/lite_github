<p>Energy starts surging through your fingertips. Sparks fly, making
the shadows grow and flicker ominously around you. You arch your
back and open your eyes as if for the first time. The text appears
more vibrant and colourful than you remember. Your fingers dance on
the keyboard commanding the cursor with a joyful precision and
control.</p>

<p>You lean back and marvel as a shimmering swirl of syntactic and
symantic structures project out of the screen and intertwine with a
fractal beauty. You watch as meaning recursively unfolds into deeper
meaning live in front of your eyes. You feel a deep and lasting
synchronicity form as the boundaries between you and your Emacs
wash away. You and your Emacs Live.</p>

<p>M-x start-hacking.</p>

<p>Lyrics:</p>

<pre><code>Code Monkey get up get coffee. Code Monkey go to job.
Code monkey have boring meeting, boring manager Rob.
Rob say Code Monkey very diligent. But his output stink.
His code not functional or elegant. What do Code Monkey think?
Code Monkey think maybe manager wanna write goddamn login page himself.
Code Monkey not say it out loud.
Code Monkey not crazy just proud.

Chorus

Code Monkey like Fritos.
Code Monkey like Tab and Mountain Dew.
Code Monkey very simple man
Big warm fuzzy secret heart
Code Monkey like you.
Code Monkey like you.

Code Monkey hang around at front desk
Tell you sweater look nice
Code Monkey offer buy you soda
Bring you cup bring you ice
You say no thank you for the soda 
cause soda make you fat
Anyway you busy with the telephone
no time for chat.

Code Monkey have long walk back to cubicle
He sit down pretend to work.
Code Monkey not thinking so straight.
Code Monkey not feeling so great.

Chorus

Code Monkey like you lots.
Code Monkey have every reason
To get out this place.
Code Monkey just keep on working
See your soft pretty face
Much rather wake up eat a coffee cake
Take bath, take nap
This job fulfilling in creative way
Such a load of crap.
Code Monkey think someday he have everything even pretty girl like you.
Code Monkey just waiting for now.
Code Monkey say someday, somehow.

Chorus
