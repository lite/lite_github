[Code Monkey AMV](http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMjk4OTI3NDc2.html)

Lyrics:

    Code Monkey get up get coffee. Code Monkey go to job.
    Code monkey have boring meeting, boring manager Rob.
    Rob say Code Monkey very diligent. But his output stink.
    His code not functional or elegant. What do Code Monkey think?
    Code Monkey think maybe manager wanna write goddamn login page himself.
    Code Monkey not say it out loud.
    Code Monkey not crazy just proud.

    Chorus

    Code Monkey like Fritos.
    Code Monkey like Tab and Mountain Dew.
    Code Monkey very simple man
    Big warm fuzzy secret heart
    Code Monkey like you.
    Code Monkey like you.

    Code Monkey hang around at front desk
    Tell you sweater look nice
    Code Monkey offer buy you soda
    Bring you cup bring you ice
    You say no thank you for the soda 
    cause soda make you fat
    Anyway you busy with the telephone
    no time for chat.

    Code Monkey have long walk back to cubicle
    He sit down pretend to work.
    Code Monkey not thinking so straight.
    Code Monkey not feeling so great.

    Chorus

    Code Monkey like you lots.
    Code Monkey have every reason
    To get out this place.
    Code Monkey just keep on working
    See your soft pretty face
    Much rather wake up eat a coffee cake
    Take bath, take nap
    This job fulfilling in creative way
    Such a load of crap.
    Code Monkey think someday he have everything even pretty girl like you.
    Code Monkey just waiting for now.
    Code Monkey say someday, somehow.

    Chorus
